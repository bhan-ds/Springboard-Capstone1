# Springboard-Capstone1
This repository contains data and work for my Springboard Capstone 1 project: Can you predict Medicare payments for a specific diagnosis in the hospital? How does that compare to other diagnoses and to Medicare payments on average?


Included:
  - Original data
  - Initial project proposal
  - Data wrangling and storytelling (included in code)
  - Statistical analysis
  - Milestone Report
  - In depth analysis including linear regression
  - Final Report
  - Slide deck
  - Jupyter notebook containing all code
  
  
Results:
   - Nationally, Medicare reimbursement has increased $440 on average. 
   - Of the top 10 most common diagnoses, 9 trend downwards and 1 is variable
      - Two of those top 10 diagnoses are major joint replacement of the lower extremity and simple pneumonia
          - Simple pneumonia is decreasing at a rate of approximately $157/year
          - Major joint replacement is decreasing by approximately $164/year
   - To account for this increase when most of the top 10 are decreasing, one possible explanation is diagnoses like heart transplant
      - Heart transplant is increasing by $7800/year 
   - If your hospital sees a lot of Medicare patients with one of the 10 most common diagnoses (most commonly in the 3xxxx zip code) there would likely be the increased financial strain of decreasing reimbursement.
